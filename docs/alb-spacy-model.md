To develop a new spaCy model for the Albanian language using open corpus, you can follow these general steps:

Collect and prepare the corpus: You will need a large and diverse collection of texts in Albanian to train your spaCy model. You can use open corpus sources like the Albanian Wikipedia, Albanian news websites, or other open datasets available online. You should clean and preprocess the text data, removing any irrelevant information and formatting the text consistently.

Install spaCy and set up a new model: You can install spaCy using pip or conda, and then set up a new blank model for the Albanian language. You can do this using the following command:

```py
!pip install spacy
!python -m spacy init-model en new_model --lang al
```

This will create a new empty spaCy model called "new_model" for the Albanian language.

Convert the corpus to spaCy format: spaCy requires the training data to be in a specific format, called "JSONL". You will need to convert your corpus to this format using spaCy's "convert" command. You can do this using the following command:

```py
!python -m spacy convert input_data.jsonl -d new_model
```

This will convert the corpus in the file "input_data.jsonl" to the spaCy format and save it in the new_model directory.

Train the spaCy model: Once you have the corpus in the spaCy format, you can train the spaCy model using the "train" command. You will need to specify the training data, validation data, and other training parameters like the number of iterations and the batch size. You can do this using the following command:

```
!python -m spacy train new_model config.cfg --output new_model_output --paths.train ./train_data.spacy --paths.dev ./dev_data.spacy
```

This will train the spaCy model using the configuration file "config.cfg", the training data in the file "train_data.spacy", and the validation data in the file "dev_data.spacy". The output files will be saved in the "new_model_output" directory.

Evaluate the spaCy model: After training the spaCy model, you should evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. You can do this using spaCy's "evaluate" command. You can do this using the following command:

```
!python -m spacy evaluate new_model_output/model-best ./test_data.spacy
```

This will evaluate the spaCy model saved in the "model-best" directory on the test data in the file "test_data.spacy".

Use the spaCy model: Once you have a trained spaCy model for Albanian, you can use it to analyze and process text in your Python code. You can load the spaCy model using the following code:

```
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("new_model_output/model-best")
```

This will load the trained spaCy model saved in the "model-best" directory. You can then use the "nlp" object to process text and extract various linguistic features.
